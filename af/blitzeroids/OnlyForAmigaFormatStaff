Hello to everybody of the Amiga Format Staff, the first thing I want t say
is that I am sorry for my bad english.  (nice start, uh?)

I've put on this disk some programs for te competition.
The main one, on which I've worked most of the few time at my disposal is
Blitzeroids.
I hope that it will run without problems in your office.
It's a fast and furious shoot'em'up vith very nice graphics, so I don't'
know where you could get a better game... (perhaps Team 17 ?)

The other program, HopalongAD, is a classic "fractal explorer" that i wrote
just to test how good is Blitz Basic 2 on using Intuition.
The result was good enought to include it on this disk.

Obviously if those two programs don't win the competition (Snif!) because
of better opponents, but you think they are still good enough for putting
them on a your Coverdisk, I'll be happy anyway... (Yes, I prefer to win)

I've sent you two disks, the contents are the same, but i've done this just
to prevent any "This disk has a READ/WRITE error" message...

Here follows my generality:
